#### QRadar App Workflows

After a developer creates an app, IBM certifies and publishes it in the IBM Security App Exchange. QRadar administrators can then browse and download the apps and then install the apps into QRadar to address specific security requirements.

Apps create or add new functionality in QRadar by providing new tabs, API methods, dashboard items, menus, toolbar buttons, configuration pages, and more within the QRadar user interface. You download apps from the IBM Security App Exchange. Apps that are created by using the GUI Application Framework Software Development Kit integrate with the QRadar user interface to deliver new security intelligence capabilities or extend the current functionality.

Every downloaded file from the IBM Security App Exchange is known as an extension. An extension can consist of an app or security product enhancement (content extension) that is packaged as an archive (.zip) file, which you can deploy on QRadar by using the Extensions Management tool on the Admin
